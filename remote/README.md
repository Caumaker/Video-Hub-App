# Video Hub App remote

This folder is intentionally left blank. It should include the latest built files from [Video Hub App remote](https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App-remote) repository.

When building VHA, this folder will be included in the build and will be served by VHA if the user turns on the server inside the app.

## How to use

1) After VHA starts, click the button to _start server_ and navigate to the URL the app displays on your phone or tablet. For better experience, proceed:
2) On iOS you can click the _Share_ icon and then "Add to Home Screen".
3) You can now tap the icon on your home screen to use the _Remote_ ðŸŽ‰
